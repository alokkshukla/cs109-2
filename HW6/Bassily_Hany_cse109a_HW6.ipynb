Assuming that each user independently rates a given movie according to the probability $\\theta_{\\text{movies}}$.

    "In this problem you'll work with some neighborhood demographics of a region in Boston from the years 2000 to 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data you need are in the files `dataset_1_year_2000.txt`, ..., `dataset_1_year_2010.txt`. The first two columns of each dataset contain the adjusted latitude and longitude of some randomly sampled houses. The last column contains economic status of a household: \n",

    "Due to the migration of people in and out of the city, the distribution of each economic group over this region changes over the years. The city of Boston estimates that in this region there is approximately a 25% yearly increase in high-income households; and a 25% decrease in the remaining population, with the decrease being roughly the same amongst both the middle class and lower income households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a model for the city of Boston that is capable of predicting the economic status of a household based on its geographical location. Furthermore, your method of prediction must be accurate over time (through 2010 and beyond). \n",

    "**Hint:** look at data only from 2000, and consider using both Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression. Is there a reason one method would more suited than the other for this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** how well do your two models do over the years? Is it possible to make use of the estimated yearly changes in proportions of the three demographic groups to improve the predictive accuracy of each models over the years? \n",

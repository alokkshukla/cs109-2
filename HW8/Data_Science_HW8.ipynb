The first two columns of the data contains the latitude and longitudes of randomly sampled locations in the satellite image, and the last column contains a label indicating whether the location contains vegetation (1 denotes the presence of vegetation and 0 denotes otherwise). The task is to, again, identify the vegetation regions in the image.\n",

Which model is more appropriate for the general task of vegetation detection in aerial images (do not restrict yourself to which model performs better on just these two datasets)? Which model is more appropriate for other types of image processing (hand-writting digit classification for example) Your comparison should be both **qualitative** and quantitative.\n",
